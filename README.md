# Day-02-Cybersecurity-Domains-Security-Operations
To understand the major cybersecurity domains, how they fit into an organization’s security operations architecture, and how offensive and defensive teams collaborate to protect systems.
                                  
                                  **Day 2 Hackathon**
                                  

**Cybersecurity Domains & Security Architecture**

 Understand Cybersecurity Domains
 
Study the core cybersecurity domains and their roles:

•	Network Security (Firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPN)

•	Application Security (OWASP Top 10)

•	Endpoint Security (AV, EDR)

•	Cloud Security (Shared Responsibility Model)

•	Identity & Access Management (IAM)


•	Incident Response & SOC Operations

Offensive vs Defensive Security

Offensive Security focuses on simulating real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. It includes activities such as penetration testing, 

vulnerability exploitation, red teaming, and attack simulations to assess the security posture of systems and applications.

Defensive Security focuses on protecting, detecting, and responding to threats. It involves monitoring systems, implementing security controls, analyzing logs, incident response, and threat 

mitigation, typically handled by blue teams and SOC operations.

Together, offensive and defensive security work collaboratively to identify weaknesses, improve detection capabilities, and strengthen overall cybersecurity resilience.

**Day 2 – Important Points**

•	Cybersecurity is divided into multiple domains such as network, application, endpoint, cloud, and identity security, each responsible for protecting different layers of an organization’s infrastructure.

•	Network security relies on controls like firewalls, IDS/IPS, and VPNs to monitor, filter, and control network traffic.

•	Application security focuses on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities defined in the OWASP Top 10, including injection flaws, broken authentication, and insecure configurations.

•	Endpoint security protects user devices through antivirus, EDR, and endpoint monitoring to detect malicious activity.

•	Cloud security follows the shared responsibility model, where the cloud provider secures the infrastructure while customers are responsible for securing data, configurations, and access controls.

•	The incident response lifecycle includes detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned, ensuring structured handling of security incidents.

•	Offensive security (Red Team) simulates attacks to identify vulnerabilities, while defensive security (Blue Team) focuses on detection, monitoring, and response.

•	SOC operations act as the central monitoring unit, correlating alerts, analyzing logs, and coordinating incident response activities.
